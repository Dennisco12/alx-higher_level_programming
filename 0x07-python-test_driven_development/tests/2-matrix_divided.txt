This test file texts the file 2-matrix_divided.py for errors

>>> matrix_divided = __import__('2-matrix_divided').matrix_divided
>>> matrix = [
...	[3, 6, 9],
...	[12, 15, 18]
... ]
>>> print(matrix_divided(matrix, 3))
[[1.0, 2.0, 3.0], [4.0, 5.0, 6.0]]

original matrix remains unchanged

>>> print(matrix)
[[3, 6, 9], [12, 15, 18]]

Doesn't work if matrix is not a list of lists of integers or floats

>>> matrix = ["Dennis", "odinaka", "Isreal", "Dera", "Great"]
>>> print(matrix_divided(matrix, 3))
Traceback (most recent call last):
TypeError: matrix must be a matrix (list of lists) of integers/floats

Also works for floats and integers

>>> matrix = [
...	[3.2, 4.8, 5.0],
...	[4, 8, 12]
... ]
>>> print(matrix_divided(matrix, 2))
[[1.6, 2.4, 2.5], [2.0, 4.0, 6.0]]

Doesn't work if div is not an int or a float

>>> matrix = [
...	[3, 6, 9],
...	[12, 15, 18],
... ]
>>> print(matrix_divided(matrix, "School"))
Traceback (most recent call last):
TypeError: div must be a number

Doesn't work if div is zero

>>> matrix = [
...	[3, 6, 9],
...	[12, 15, 18]
... ]
>>> print(matrix_divided(matrix, 0))
Traceback (most recent call last):
ZeroDivisionError: division by zero
